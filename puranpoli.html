    <h3>Instructions</h3>
     <b>Prepare the Dough</b>
         <p>
        In a bowl, mix 2 cups of whole wheat flour with a pinch of salt.
        Gradually add water and knead the mixture into a soft, pliable dough.
        Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.
        </p>

       <b>Make the Filling:</b>
        <p>
        Rinse 1 cup of split chickpeas (chana dal) and cook them in water until they are soft. Drain any excess water and allow them to cool.
        In a mixing bowl, mash the cooked chickpeas.
        Add 1 cup of grated jaggery and 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom powder to the mashed chickpeas.
        Cook this mixture on low heat for a few minutes, stirring until the jaggery melts and everything is well combined. Allow it to cool.
        </p>
        
        <b>Assemble the Puran Poli:</b>
        <p>
        Divide the dough and the filling into equal portions (about 8-10).
        Take one portion of dough and flatten it slightly. Place one portion of the filling in the center.
        Fold the dough over the filling to seal it completely, ensuring there are no gaps.
        Gently roll it out into a flat disc, being careful not to let the filling spill out.
        </p>
        <b>
        Cook the Puran Poli:</b>
        <p>
        Heat a griddle or tava over medium heat.
        Place the rolled puran poli on the griddle and cook until light brown spots appear on one side.
        Flip it over and brush a little ghee on the cooked side. Cook the other side until it’s golden brown, brushing with ghee as needed.
        </p>

        <b>Serve:</b>
        <p>
        Serve the puran poli warm, optionally with a little ghee on top or alongside milk.
