    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <b>Make the Filling:</b>
<p>
Heat 1 tablespoon of ghee in a pan on low heat.
Add 1 cup of grated coconut and cook for a couple of minutes.
Mix in 3/4 cup of grated jaggery and cook until it melts and combines with the coconut.
Add 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom powder and mix well. Let it cool.</p>
<b>Prepare the Outer Dough:</b>
<p>
In a saucepan, boil 1 cup of water with a pinch of salt.
Slowly add 1 cup of rice flour while stirring to avoid lumps.
Cook until the mixture thickens and forms a dough.
Let it cool slightly, then knead it until smooth.</p>
<b>Shape the Modaks:</b>
<p>
Grease your hands with a little ghee.
Take a small piece of dough and flatten it into a disc.
Place a spoonful of the coconut filling in the center.
Fold the edges over the filling to form a cone or use a modak mold.</p>
<b>Steam the Modaks:</b>
<p>
Arrange the shaped modaks in a steamer lined with banana leaves or parchment paper.
Steam for about 10-15 minutes until shiny and firm.</p>
<b>Serve:</b>
<p>
Serve the modaks warm, optionally with a little ghee on top.</p>
